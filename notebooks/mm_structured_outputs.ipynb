        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "**Structured Outputs** refers to a family of features that enables language models to respond in a constrained format. While language models continue to improve and demonstrate emergent abilities, their unpredictable nature make them difficult to integrate with traditional software systems. Most real-world AI uses-cases leverage structured outputs to some extent, whether that be to execute tool calls or adhere to Pydantic Models. \n",
        "\n",
        "As a core primative of almost every LM workload, here are a few canonical references for structured outputs that are worth saving:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Getting Structured LLM Output** from dottxt founders Will Kurt & Cameron Pfiffer (DeepLearning.ai Course)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/getting-structured-llm-output/information)\n",
        "- [**Coding for Structured Generation with LLMs** by Will Kurt](https://blog.dottxt.ai/coding-for-structured-generation.html)\n",
        "- [**Structured Decoding in vLLM: A Gentle Introduction** by Aaron Pham](https://www.bentoml.com/blog/structured-decoding-in-vllm-a-gentle-introduction#user-content-fn-7)\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Structured Outputs?\n",
        "\n",
        "The underlying technology that makes structured outputs is called guided decoding. Guided decoding uses logits to control the output of a language model by adjusting the probabilities of the next possible tokens to enforce constraints or guide the generation process. This can be done through various methods, such as applying a logit bias to penalize or promote specific tokens, filtering invalid tokens based on rules like a Finite State Machine (FSM), or by using more advanced techniques to interact with the model's internal probability distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Structured Outputs consists of 5 strategies that define the desired output type:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Basic Python Types: `int`, `float`, `bool`...\n",
        "- Multiple Choices: using `Literal` or `Enum`\n",
        "- JSON Schemas: using Pydantic models or dataclasses\n",
        "- Regex\n",
        "- Context-free Grammars\n",
        "\n",
        "While there are tremendous number of examples in pure python, few tutorials exist that demonstrate structured outputs within a large-scale processing context. Even fewer, if any, examples exist that demonstrate how to run batch structured outputs with multimodal data on your own inference server. Here, we will walk you through the entire process, using your own OpenAI-compatible server using [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.6.3.post1/serving/openai_compatible_server.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is an LLM-as-a-Judge?\n",
        "\n",
        "LLM-as-a-Judge is a framework where a language model evaluates the outputs of other AI systems—providing qualitative assessments beyond simple accuracy metrics. Rather than relying solely on human evaluation (expensive, slow, inconsistent) or traditional metrics like BLEU/ROUGE (surface-level, miss semantic nuance), LLM judges can assess relevance, coherence, factual accuracy, and instruction adherence at scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "The approach was formalized in the seminal paper introducing MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena, which demonstrated that strong LLMs like GPT-4 can achieve ~80% agreement with human preferences—comparable to inter-annotator agreement between humans themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we extend LLM-as-a-Judge to the multimodal domain, using a vision-language model to analyze why our image understanding pipeline succeeded or failed on specific examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "See also: \n",
        "- Judging LLM-as-a-Judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena — Zheng et al. (NeurIPS 2023)\n",

        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Large scale multimodal structured outputs is a real world use-case that every enterprise team faces when attempting to work with massive amounts of internal/private data. These teams face significant hurdles with traditional tooling, especially for cutting-edge uses cases like batch tool calls for background agents or reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. \n",
        "\n",
        "Daft's unified multimodal data processing engine is purpose built to support workloads like this and is rapidly becoming the default engine of choice for teams deploying frontier AI solutions in production.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will leverage Daft to evaluate the image understanding accuracy of [Qwen3 VL 8b](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-VL) using HugginFace's [the_cauldron dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceM4/the_cauldron). By the end of this notebook, you will be ready to implement your own distributed batch structured outputs pipeline with a copy-paste script you can use in your own environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "> NOTE:\n",
        "  This Notebook contains an advanced path where you can use vLLM as your inference solution. In this case, Google Colab's A100 GPU instance is recommended. Additionally, in order to access to [qwen/qwen3-vl-8b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct) you will need accept Google's usage policy and authenticate with HuggingFace. If you do not have access to a GPU, you can use the OpenRouter instead.\n",

The image clearly depicts an arrow pointing from the kangaroo rat to the snake, indicating that snakes prey on kangaroo rats. If kangaroo rats go extinct, the snake population should decrease due to loss of a food source, not increase. The model may have incorrectly assumed the arrow represents a mutualistic or non-consumptive relationship, or it may have misread the directionality of the arrow. Without the image, the model might have guessed based on general knowledge, but with the image, it should have been able to directly infer the causal relationship from the diagram. The error stems from a failure to correctly interpret the directional arrows in the food web as representing predation (snake → kangaroo rat means snake eats kangaroo rat), leading to the incorrect conclusion that snake populations would increase.</div></td><td data-row=\"2\" data-col=\"4\"><div style=\"text-align:left; width: calc(100vw / 6); min-width: 192px; max-height: 100px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; word-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto\">The model misread the food web diagram, interpreting the arrow from kangaroo rat to snake as indicating a beneficial or non-harmful relationship, rather than predation, leading it to incorrectly predict that snake populations would increase if kangaroo rats went extinct.</div></td><td data-row=\"2\" data-col=\"5\"><div style=\"text-align:left; width: calc(100vw / 6); min-width: 192px; max-height: 100px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; word-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto\">The model's answer is incorrect because it fails to correctly interpret the directional arrows in the food web diagram as representing predation, leading to a flawed causal inference.</div></td></tr>\n",

diagram. The model may have misinterpreted the diagram’s structure, assuming that any direct arrow implies a stronger or more direct dependency than other arrows. In reality, the diagram shows that termites are preyed upon by multiple species including dingoes, crocodiles, frill-necked lizards, gould’s goanna, blue-winged kookaburra, and mice and rats. The Northern brown bandicoot is also preyed upon by many of these same predators. However, the diagram does not indicate that termites are the *primary* or *most direct* food source for the Northern brown bandicoot. The model’s choice reflects a failure to understand that the diagram represents predator-prey relationships, and that the *most directly affected* population would be the one that consumes termites as a primary food source — which is not explicitly shown for the Northern brown bandicoot. The model’s choice of B (Mice) without the image suggests it may have been relying on text-based reasoning or a flawed understanding of the diagram’s structure. The correct answer, A (Dingoes), is not chosen because the model failed to recognize that dingoes are at the top of the food chain and consume multiple prey species, including termites, making them indirectly affected — but the question asks for the population *most directly affected*, which would be the predators that rely heavily on termites.

food web's structure, specifically the direct dependency of Anchovy on Algae. While Anchovy does consume Algae (as shown by the arrow from Algae to Anchovy), it is not the most dependent organism in the web. Sand Shrimp, which also feeds directly on Algae, is a more direct and primary consumer than Anchovy, which is a secondary consumer (also feeding on Mysid shrimp). The model may have incorrectly assumed that since Anchovy is a larger or more prominent fish in the diagram, it would be the most affected by a reduction in algae, ignoring the fact that Sand Shrimp is a primary consumer with no other food source shown in the diagram. The correct answer is B (Sand Shrimp) because it is the organism that directly relies on algae for energy and has no alternative food source shown in the food web, making it the most vulnerable to a decrease in algae availability.</div></td><td data-row=\"5\" data-col=\"4\"><div style=\"text-align:left; width: calc(100vw / 6); min-width: 192px; max-height: 100px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; word-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto\">The model misidentified Anchovy as the most affected organism due to its position in the food web or its size, rather than recognizing that Sand Shrimp is a direct primary consumer with no alternative food source shown.</div></td><td data-row=\"5\" data-col=\"5\"><div style=\"text-align:left; width: calc(100vw / 6); min-width: 192px; max-height: 100px; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; word-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto\">The model's answer is incorrect because it failed to correctly interpret the food web's energy flow, particularly the direct dependency of Sand Shrimp on algae, which makes it the most affected by a decrease in algae.</div></td></tr>\n",

        "In this notebook we explored how to evaluate Qwen-3-VL's image understanding using a subset from HuggingFace's TheCauldron Dataset. The AI2D subset we used is just one of a massive collection of 50 vision-language datasets that can be used for evaluating or training vision language models totaling millions of rows. You can also leverage this pipeline to evaluate model performance across sampling parameters or model variants. Please note that not all Qwen-3-VL models support image inputs, and leveraging datasets outside of the *The Cauldron* would require different preprocessing stages.\n",
